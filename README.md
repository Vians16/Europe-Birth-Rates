Birth Rates in Europe: 
A Data Analytics Project


Overview
This project explores the decline in birth rates across Europe over the last two decades, identifying key socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related factors influencing these trends. Through data-driven insights and visualizations, we aim to uncover actionable recommendations to address this critical issue.

Key Areas of Analysis
1. Trends and Patterns
•	Analyzed general trends in birth rates from 2000 to 2024.
•	Explored regional differences across Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western Europe.
2. Socioeconomic Correlations
•	Investigated relationships between birth rates and factors like GDP per capita, average salaries, and unemployment rates.
•	Examined how health expenditure impacts birth and fertility rates.
3. Demographic and Social Factors
•	Evaluated the role of women’s education and average age at marriage in birth rate trends.
4. Urbanization and Population
•	Explored the impact of urbanization and rural vs. urban population distribution on birth rates.
5. Health Indicators
•	Studied how infant mortality rates and health expenditure influence fertility trends.

Datasets Used
A total of 14 datasets were processed, analyzed, and visualized, including:
•	Birth Rates (2000-2024)
•	Fertility Rates
•	GDP Per Capita
•	Health Expenditure
•	Women’s Education Levels
•	Infant Mortality Rates
•	Urban and Rural Population Data
•	Women’s Average Age at Marriage
•	Average Salaries
Each dataset was standardized and cleaned to ensure consistency, with key transformations applied for vertical formatting, filtering European countries, and joining datasets.

Key Findings
1.	The birth rate in Europe has declined by over 20% in the last 20 years, with notable regional disparities.
2.	Socioeconomic factors like GDP per capita and health expenditure show a significant correlation with birth and fertility rates.
3.	Urbanization and higher education levels among women are inversely correlated with birth rates.
4.	Infant mortality rates have steadily declined, but their relationship with fertility varies by region.
